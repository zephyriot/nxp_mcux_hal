The NXP MCUXpresso Software Development Kit (MCUX) provides device header files
and peripheral drivers for Kinetis, LPC, and i.MX SoCs.

It was previously called the Kinetis Software Development Kit (KSDK), then
renamed to include support for LPC and i.MX SoCs.

The K64F, KW22D5, KW24D5 and KW41Z sources in this directory are imported
from mcux.nxp.com.

MCUX for KW40Z is not yet deployed on mcux.nxp.com like most other devices,
therefore the sources are imported from the KW40Z product pages on nxp.com:
